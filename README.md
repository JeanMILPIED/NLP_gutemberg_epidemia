# NLP_gutemberg_epidemia
consolidating databases for a future NLP project

## STEP1: database
I have extracted and consolidated a databse with all the french books and their text (.txt file) from the gutemberg project.  
https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/fr  
The csv file is available on my github with the foolowing metrics:  
- 4117 ebooks
- 1474 authors
- 22 authors have more than 20 books in the database like Sand, Dumas, Verne, Maupassant, Zola, Hugo, Daudet
- authors birth year ranges from 56 to 1954 with a median in 1825
- authors death year ranges from 104 to 1985 with a median in 1887
- the distribution of books per century is as followed. A majority of books from the XIXth century:  
    1st  :      3  
    15th :      8  
    16th :     68  
    17th :     81  
    18th :    214  
    19th :   2539  
    20th :    214
